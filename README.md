# In this project, deep convolution neuron network in PyTorch with CUDA module has been applied to train CIFAR-10 dataset. We expored several different architecture like resnet and used several tuning methods like dropout and batchnormalization with basic methods like relu and maxpooling and our final accuracy is 86.5% for validation set(we leave 10% of the training set for validation). In other part of the project, we used transfer learining to train Caltech256 dataset. The pretrained model we use is VGG-16. And we explored using the first three layers and first four layers as the pretrained models and then adding fully collected layer to see the result. The final accuracy we get is at around 70%.
